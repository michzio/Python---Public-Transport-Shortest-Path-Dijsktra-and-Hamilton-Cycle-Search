# Python---Public-Transport-Shortest-Path-Dijsktra-and-Hamilton-Cycle-Search
This is program that uses Dijkstra algorithm in order to find shortest connection
in public transport network implemented as directed graph with time as edges weight. 
Program also enable to find Hamilton cycle resolving "Travelling salesman problem" 
using Simulated annealing algorithm.
